# Text-Summarizer
**Text Summarizer Project**   This project simplifies lengthy text into concise summaries while retaining essential meaning and context. It uses natural language processing techniques like extractive summarization, which selects key sentences, or abstractive summarization, which generates summaries through models like Transformers.
